= Creating a Restore

== Introduction

A Trilio Restore is a Kubernetes resource that restores a backup in the same or different namespace.

== Create the Restore
To restore a backup into a new namespace:

. On the left menu, click on *Home -> Projects* and click the *Create Project* button.
. For *Name* enter *vmrestored-{user}* and click *Create*
. On the left menu, click on *Trilio Backups -> Restores* and ensure the project is selected as *vmrestored*
. Click on the *Create Restore* button
. On the *Restore a backup* form, select *backup-1-{user}* from the list and click *Next*
. Enter *vmrestored-{user}* in the *Search by name...* field and ensure it is selected and click *Next*
. For *Restore Name* enter *restore-1-{user}* and click *Create*
. Once the *Restore a backup* form is submitted, you will be redirected to the *Restores* landing page.
When the status for *restore-1-{user}* shows as *Completed*, your restore is complete.
This process may take a few minutes.

== Validating the Restore
When the restore is complete, we want to ensure that our restore contains all the files we persisted in the backup.

. On the left menu, click on *Virtualization -> VirtualMachines* and on the *Project* drop-down, ensure the project *vmrestored-{user}* is selected.
. Notice that the Virtual Machines have been restored in your new OpenShift Project.
