= Creating a Restore

== Introduction

A Trilio Restore is a Kubernetes resource that restores a backup in the same or different namespace.

== Create the Restore
To restore a backup into a new namespace:

. On the left menu, click on *Home -> Projects* and click the *Create Project* button.
. For *Name* ebter *vmrestored* and click *Create*
. On the left menu, click on *Trilio Backups -> Restores* and ensure the project is selected as *vmrestored*
. Click on the *Create Restore* button
. On the *Restore a backup* form, select *backup-1* from the list and click *Next*
. Enter *vmrestored* in the *Search by name...* field and ensure it is selected and click *Next*
. For *Restore Name* enter *restore-1* and click *Create*
. Once the *Restore a backup* form is submitted, you will be redirected to the *Restores* landing page. When the status for *restore-1* shows as *Available*, your restore is complete.  This process may take a few minutes.

== Validating the Restore
When the restore is complete, we want to ensure that our restore contains all the files we persisted in the backup.

. On the left menu, click on *Virtualization -> VirtualMachines* and on the *Project* drown down, ensure the project *vmrestored* is selected.
. Notice that the Virtual Machines have been restored in your new OpenShift Project.
