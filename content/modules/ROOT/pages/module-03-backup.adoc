= Creating a Backup

== Introduction

A Trilio Backup is a Kubernetes resource that references the actual backup Trilio creates on the Target. The backup is taken as either a Full or Incremental backup as defined by the user in the Backup CR.

Trilio makes it easy to automatically create your backup plans and all required target and policy CRDs from the  Console.

== Backup Validation
Before we create a backup, we want to ensure that our backup is storing our latest files in the target.  To ensure this is being done, we will create a file on one of the virtual machines to validate the backup.

. On the left menu, click on *Virtualization -> VirtualMachines* and on the *Project* drown down, ensure the project *vmimported* is selected.
. Click on *winweb01*
. Click on the *console* tab
. On the VNC console, enter *15* and hit *enter*

. Run the below commands to create a file on the virtual machine and verify it has been created.

[source,sh,role=execute]
----
echo 'Hello World!' > backup-file.txt
cat .\backup-file.txt
----

== Create the Backup

. On the left menu, click on *Trilio Backups -> Backups* and click the *Create Backup* button
. On the *Backup a namespace* form, enter *vmimported* in the *Search by name...* field and ensure it is selected. Click *Next*
. For *Target*, select *target-1*.  For more information on how to create a *Backup Schedule* or *Retention Schedule*, refer to this link https://docs.trilio.io/kubernetes/getting-started/red-hat-openshift#about-backup-plans-and-backups[About Backup Plans and Backups].  Click *Next*
. For *Backup Name*, enter *backup-1* and then click *Create*

. Once the *Backup a namespace* form is submitted, you will be redirected to the *Backups* landing page. When the status for *backup-1* shows as *Available*, your backup is complete.  This process may take a few minutes.
