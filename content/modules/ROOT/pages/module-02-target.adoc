= Creating a Backup Target

== Introduction

A Trilio Backup Target is a Kubernetes resource that defines the backup repository location used to store the backup files.
This location can be defined as a *Network File System (NFS)* or an *Object Store* such as AWS, MinIO, Ceph S3, Wasabi, etc.
In this section of the demo, we will attempt to create a Backup Target that will host all backup files for the *vmimported-{user}* namespace.

== Virtual Machines

. Login to your {openshift_console_url}[OpenShift Console^] with user *{user}* and password *{password}*.
. On the left menu, click on *Virtualization -> VirtualMachines* and on the *Project* drown down, select the project *vmimported-{user}*

+
There are 3 Virtual Machines that are displayed.
We will be back up and restore one of them to another namespace.
. Our Target will be set up to store backed-up files on a MinIO S3 target.

=== Start `winweb01`

We will be modifying the files on this VM, so we will start it now to save time in the next module.

. Click the *Start button* next to *winweb01*.

== Create the S3 Credentials Secret for the Backup Target

In order for Trilio to upload the files to this location, it will require login credentials, created as a Kubernetes secret, in the namespace we are trying to back up:

. On the left menu, select *Workloads -> Secrets* and ensure your Project is selected as *vmimported-{user}*.
. Click on the *Create* button and select *Key/value secret*
. For *Secret name* enter *minio-s3-login*
. For *Key* enter *accessKey*
. For *Value* enter *minio*
. Click on *Add key/value*
. For the second *Key* enter *secretKey*
. And for the *Value* enter *{password}*
. Click *Create*

== Create the Backup Target
Now that you have the credentials to your target location, you can begin creating the Backup Target.

. On the left menu, click *Trilio Backups -> Targets* and ensure your Project is selected as *vmimported-{user}*.
. Click the *Create Target* button. You will be presented with a *Create Target* form.

. For *Namespace*, select *vmimported-{user}*
. For *Name*, enter *target-1-{user}*
. Ignore the *Threshold Capacity* as this is not required for the demo.
. For *Vendor details*, select *Object Store*
. For *Vendor*, select *MinIO*
. For *Secrets*, look for your namespace *vmimported-{user}* and select *minio-s3-login*, which you just created.
. For *Bucket Name*, enter *s3-{user}*.
This bucket has already been created for you on MinIO.
. Ignore *Region*
. For *URL*, enter *http://minio.minio.svc.cluster.local:9000*
. Click *Submit*
. Once the *Create Target* form is submitted, you will be redirected to the *Targets* landing page.
Once the status for *target-1-{user}* shows *Available*, your target is successfully created.

To monitor the progress of creating your target, you can view the *tvk-target-validation...* pod logs in the *trilio-system* namespace.
